# farsdata

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/Noob-Programr/farsdata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Noob-Programr/farsdata)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of farsdata is to provide functions that will be using data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes, to plot
the data on a US Map and summarize it as well. The package uses datasets on accidents recorded in the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.

## Installation

You can install the released version of farsdata from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("farsdata")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(farsdata)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
